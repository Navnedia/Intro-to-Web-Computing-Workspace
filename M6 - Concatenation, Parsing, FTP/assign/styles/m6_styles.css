/* For some reason I couldn't figure out, my div section for the second
   output had a border a lot wider than the content, and of course the 
   border was always slightly visable even when there was no content. I
   decided to solve both these issues by using the child combinator to
   apply my border styles to the <p> tag that comes from the innerHTML
   output; this way the border is the correct size, and it only appears
   when there is content in the div.*/
