/*
 * It was a little unclear on where you wanted this comment, but I
 * figured here made the most sense. Padding and margin can at first
 * glace seem the same, but there is a key diffrence you must understand
 * to make effective use of the two CSS properties. Both padding and margin
 * allow you do add a specified spacing around something. The diffrence
 * between the two is that padding spesifies the spacing between the content
 * and the border (even when there is no border), then margins are used to
 * specifiy the space outside the border sperating the block from other things.
