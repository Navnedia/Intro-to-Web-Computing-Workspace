                <h2>A Breif History</h2>
                <p>Star Wars is an American epic space-opera multimedia franchise created by George
                    Lucas, which began with the eponymous 1977 film and quickly became a worldwide
                    pop-culture phenomenon. The franchise has been expanded into various films and other
                    media, including television series, video games, novels, comic books, theme park 
                    attractions, and themed areas, comprising an all-encompassing fictional universe. In
                    2020, its total value was estimated at US$70 billion, and it is currently the 
                    fifth-highest-grossing media franchise of all time.</p>

<!--Importance of Semantic Tags:
    It may seem annoying to some that we choose to spend time adding semantic tags when
    they have no visual effect on our web page, but in fact, there are a lot of great reasons
    to include semantic tags!

    1) Perhaps the most important reason is that semantic tags make our web pages more accessible.
       as web developers, it's very important to consider what we can do to make our pages accessible
       to more people. Semantic tags are used by screen reading applications to help them understand
       the structure of your page.
    
    2) Semantic tags are also a great way to improve the consistency, clarity, and efficiency of our
       code. These qualities are things we want to strive for as programmers and semantic tags help
       with this by breaking the code into smaller sections that can be understood. They help our code
       flow better, and they can be great when it comes time to do some serious CSS styling.
    
    3) Using semantic tags can even help boost your site rankings in a web search on platforms like Google.
       When search engines go to index your website they often use the semantic tags to guide their search,
       so having clear semantic styling can help it understand your page contents.-->
