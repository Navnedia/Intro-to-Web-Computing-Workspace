        <!-- The term "programming convention" is used to define a set of general standards and practices
            when writing code. The purpose of programming conventions is to promote consistent code throughout
            a programming language, organization, or company. In this HTML context, programming conventions can
            apply to the style we construct our code in using white space and indentations to make things extra clear.
            This could relate to how we name our files with lower case and underscores, or how we structure
            our folders. This term can even apply to how we name our form id attributes with prefixes in camelcase. 
            
            When we commit ourselves to maintaining these standards because it makes code more organized, clean, easier
            to follow, and easier to debug/maintain for not just our future selfs, but also for others. 
            Consistency can be the mark of a quality programmer.-->
