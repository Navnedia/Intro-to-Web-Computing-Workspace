                <h2>Characters</h2>
                <p><span class="florid-letter">T</span>he Simpsons is known for its wide ensemble of main and
                    supporting characters (ensemble cast).The main characters are the Simpson family, who live 
                    in a fictional "Middle America" town of Springfield.[10] Homer, the father, works as a safety
                    inspector at the Springfield Nuclear Power Plant, a position at odds with his careless, 
                    buffoonish personality. He is married to  Marge Bouvier, a stereotypical American housewife 
                    and mother. They have three children: Bart, a ten-year-old troublemaker and prankster; Lisa,
                    a precocious eight-year-old activist; and Maggie, the baby of the family who rarely speaks,
                    but communicates by sucking on a pacifier. Although the family is dysfunctional, many episodes
                    examine their relationships and bonds with each other and they are often shown to care about 
                    one another.[11]</p>

                    <h2>Setting</h2>
                    <p><span class="florid-letter">T</span>he Simpsons takes place in the <span class="underline">fictional American 
                        town of Springfield</span> in an unknown and impossible-to-determine U.S. state. The show is
                        intentionally evasive in regard to Springfield's location.[14] Springfield's geography, 
                        and that of its surroundings, contains coastlines, deserts, vast farmland, tall mountains
                        , or whatever the story or joke requires.[15] Groening has said that Springfield has much
                        in common with Portland, Oregon, the city where he grew up.[16]</p>
