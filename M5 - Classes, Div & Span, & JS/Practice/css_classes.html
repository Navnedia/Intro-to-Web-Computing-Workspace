                <h3 class="heading-box">Education</h3>
                <p>I went to high school at ETHS in Evanston. I graduated with honors and I achieved 
                    National Honor Society. I'm currently working towards my CS degree at DePaul.
                    I took several programming courses in high school, and now I'm continuing this 
                    passion into college..</p>

                <h3 class="heading-box">Experience</h3>
                <p>Naturally, I'm majoring in computer science. I absolutely love experimenting eith code because 
                    I apriciate a good challenge. It's exhilarating to discover new things and learn how to solve 
                    problems; the problem solving aspect of CS is by far my favorite part of the field. I have some 
                    experience from high school and college working with diffrent languages and technologies: a small 
                    amount of JavaScript, small amount of C#, some experience with the Unity game engine, but the language 
                    I'm most familiar with is Java (around 2 years of experience through courses). I'm hoping to start learning
                    other languages more seriously soon as most of the other languages besides Java aren't very fresh in my mind.
                    I've also recently started learning Git with GitHub. In my free time I enjoy experimenting with new technology
                    and coding my own projects for experience. I also enjoy playing games, watching shows, and listening to music 
                    in my free time...</p>
