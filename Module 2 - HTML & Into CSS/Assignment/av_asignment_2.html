        <!--Creating header for the list section: I wasn't sure if it had to be white on black,
            but based on the phrasing of the last requirment bullet point I figured it was ok
            to explore colors. 

            I used inline CSS to set the styling and I used a font family to have fall back fonts
            incase the users web client fails to display the first font. I also set the color of the
            font to a tealish blue and made the background a gray so you can still see the text.-->

            I'm talking about Spotify stats, I choose to link to the songs on YouTube because then
            this makes it more accessible to those without spotify.-->

        <h3>HTML Comments and Why You Should Use Them</h3>

        <!--I though about using the <code> tag for the code in the paragraph below because it
            might help the code part stand out and look more normal. I noticed that this was used
            in the a2 asignment page. I decided not to because we haven't taked about it, and
            I was concerned this may count as using it for styling purposes.-->
        <p>Most coding languages have some way of adding comment to your code. Comments are an extreemly important 
            part of any coding language. To make comments in HTML we use the comment tag &lt;!-- to 
            open a comment, and --&gt;. When put together it looks like this &lt;!--comment--&gt;.
            A comment tag like this allows you to place comments directly into your HTML source code because the 
            tag tells your browser to ignore the writing inside and not display it to the screen. Comments can be
            used for anything, but code comments are particularly useful because they allow us as programers to
            describe sections of code, leave notes for ourselves, and describe why things have been coded how they
            were. Using comments for some of the ways mention above can improve clarity and mantainability by help
            make your code clearer and understandable to others, and to yourself down the line. One tip worth noting
            is that in VSCode you can select any line then use use Ctrl + / to turn the link into a comment or a 
            blank comment with an empty line. Using the shortcut again uncomments the line. For more information
            on developing good commenting practices:

        <h3>Why Some HTML Tags and Attributes Become Deprecated</h3>
        <p>
            The term "deprecated" is a common piece of code termonology used with many diffrent languages. The 
            term deprecated is used to indicate that the use of a piece of code is being discourged as it's 
            phased out. Often, when something is deprecated this means that it's being replaced by a diffrent 
            standard or technique for acomplishing the task that might be preferable to the former. We choose to 
            deprecat things rather than just removing them because this gives developers time to transition away 
            and start using alternative stratiges and aviod breaking code.</p>

        <p>
            With HTML, we see tags like the font tag &lt;font&gt;, the centering tag &lt;center&gt;, the text size
            tag &lt;big&gt;, the strikethrough tag &lt;strike&gt;, and a number of other tags are all concidered 
            deprecated. We also attributes like "align", "size", "text" (for text color), and others have been 
            deprcated for some uses. So why are these tags deprecated? Well, in this case, many though not all of 
            the deprecated tags and attributes have been deprecated because HTML is moving away from styling/formating
            the page using any HTML. HTML should strictly be used for adding the content to the page, for styling, CSS
            should be used. The use of CSS over HTML for styling has a number of important benifits. CSS styling allows
            for standardization and consitency cross platform, cleaner code, and it makes changing styling across
            your page (internal CSS), or even across your entire site extreemly simple (external CSS).</p>
