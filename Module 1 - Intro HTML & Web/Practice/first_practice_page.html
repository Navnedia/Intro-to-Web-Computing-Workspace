        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>My name is Aiden Vandekerckhove...</p>

        <h3>Education</h3>
        <p>My name is Aiden. I'm a freshman at DePaul University in the CDM. I have ADHD, so education has 
            was once a struggle for me, and it still often is. Ever since discovering my true passionate 
            for technology I've remained motivated in my education, and I have developed a real love of learning 
            and problem solving.</p>

        <h3>Experience</h3>
        <p>Naturally, I'm majoring in computer science. I absolutely love experimenting eith code because 
            I apriciate a good challenge. It's exhilarating to discover new things and learn how to solve 
            problems; the problem solving aspect of CS is by far my favorite part of the field. I have some 
            experience from high school and college working with diffrent languages and technologies: a small 
            amount of JavaScript, small amount of C#, some experience with the Unity game engine, but the language 
            I'm most familiar with is Java (around 2 years of experience through courses). I'm hoping to start learning
            other languages more seriously soon as most of the other languages besides Java aren't very fresh in my mind.
            I've also recently started learning Git with GitHub. In my free time I enjoy experimenting with new technology
            and coding my own projects for experience. I also enjoy playing games, watching shows, and listening to music 
            in my free time.</p>
