        <h1>Aiden V - IT 130 Assignment 1</h1>

        <h2>Exam Information</h2>
        <p>For this Intro to Web Computing (IT 130) there will be a final exam. This exam is a required part of this course
            and students who neglect to take the exam within the testing window will not receive a passing grade in this course.
            With this exam, ALL students who are taking this course in any online format are required to take their final exam 
            IN PRESON. Online students should register for an open testing time slot and location as soon as registration becomes
            available (around 2 weeks before finals week). The exam must be taken in person, and there WILL NOT be any opportunity to 
            complete the Final exam online. There are two ways to take your in person exam. The exam will be facilitated at DePaul on 
            campus for those who are able to come to campus. Because not everyone is able, for those who are can't to come to campus 
            (living more that 30 miles away), the exam may be taken at a licensed testing location.</p>

        <p>I have read and understood the syllabus in it's entirety including the course requirment that I must take any course
            exams at DePaul, or at a professional, licensed proctoring service (provided you live > 30 miles away).<br>

        <h2>Other Important Course Details</h2>
        <p>Another important thing to note is that all assignments in this course have a listed due date. This is the date you should
            shoot for to best stay on scheduel with the course, and to recive full marks on the assignment. That being said, IF you are
            unable to complete and turn in an assignment by the listed due date, you still have the opportunity to submit the assignment
            for partial credit up to two days after the listed due date is the end date. Late work will have 3 points deducted from the
            per day late.</p>

        <p>Email formating tip: When emailing professor Yosef for any reason it's important that you include your name, the course number,
            and your normal subject line pertaining to your question (e.g. Vandekerckhove IT-130: Question about Web Servers). Doing this 
            ensure the email is seen and not placed into spam.</p>

        <p>Because this course is online it's good to have things be as clear and organized as possible to ensure nothing is missed, this 
            is why the primary form of comunication to the class moving forward will be the D2L New postings and not email. Putting the 
            comunications here ensures the clarity of comunications because all the information can be seen in one common place. All That
            being said, it's important to subscribe to the News postings so you will get the important notification and not miss any future 
            comunications and important information. I acknowledge that I have made sure to subscribe to notifications on this news feed.</p>
