        <h1>IT 130 Assignment 1 - Course Tips & Information</h1>

        <h2>Exam Information</h2>
        <p>For this Intro to Web Computing (IT 130) course, there will be a final exam. This exam is a required part of the course
            and students who neglect to take the exam within the testing window will not receive a passing grade in this course.
            With this exam, ALL students who are taking the course in any online format are required to take their final exam 
            IN PERSON. Online students should register for an open testing time slot and location as soon as registration becomes
            available (around 2 weeks before finals week). The exam must be taken in person, and there WILL NOT be an opportunity to 
            complete the Final exam online. There are two ways to take the in-person exam. The exam will be facilitated at DePaul on 
            campus for those who are able to come to campus. Because not everyone is able, for those who can't come to campus 
            (living more than 30 miles away), the exam may alternativly be taken at a licensed testing location.</p>

        <p>I have read and understood the syllabus in its entirety including the course requirement that I must take any
            exams  for this course at DePaul, or at a professional, licensed proctoring service (provided I live more than 30 miles 
            away, which I do not). Aiden Jack Vandekerckhove 03/30/2022</p>
        
        <h2>Other Important Course Details</h2>
        <p>Another important thing to note is that all assignments in this course have a listed due date. This is the date you should
            shoot for to best stay on schedule with the course, and to receive full marks on the assignment. Ideally, asignments should
            be completed even before this deadline That being said, IF you are unable to complete and turn in an assignment by the listed
            due date, you still have the opportunity to submit the assignment for partial credit up to two days after the listed due date
            is the end date. Late work will have 3 points deducted per day late.</p>

        <p>Email formating tip: When emailing professor Yosef for any reason it's important that you include your name, the course number,
            and your normal subject line pertaining to your question (e.g. Vandekerckhove IT-130: Question about Web Servers). Doing this 
            ensures the email is seen and not placed into spam.</p>

        <p>Because this course is online it's good to have things be as clear and organized as possible to ensure nothing is missed, this 
            is why the primary form of communication moving forward will be the D2L News postings and not email. Putting the 
            communications here ensures the clarity of communications because all the information can be seen in one commonplace. All that
            being said, it's important to subscribe to the News postings so you will get the important notifications and not miss any future 
            communications and important information. I acknowledge that I have made sure to subscribe to notifications on the news feed.</p>

        <p>All quizzes in this course have been set up so that you may take them as many times as you would like for the purpose of practicing
            and studying the material, HOWEVER, it's important to understand that only your first attempt on the quiz will be graded because
            the answers are displayed after the first submission. In the case of the syllabus quiz, that quiz may be taken and graded as many
            times as you choose but this is the only quiz with this exception to the rule. Note that the two lowest quiz grades
            from the quarter will be dropped.</p>

        <p>The last important thing to note is the ways in which you can find help for this course. These ways include the D2l discussion
            board where students and professor Yosef will be able to answer your questions and share answers with the whole class. The 
            discussion board is particularly useful for technical or clarifying questions because if you're struggling, then there's a good 
            chance others are as well, so putting the answer on the discussion board can help them too. You can also reach out to professor 
            Yosef privately over email (making sure to use the subject line we discussed above) and ask him about anything you find interesting
            or need help with. Finally, feel free to make use of the amazing free tutoring with the CDM for any additional help.</p>

        <p>Now that you know these tips and essential pieces of information about the course you're ready to jump in and make the most of it.
            Enjoy, I know you'll do great! :)</p>
